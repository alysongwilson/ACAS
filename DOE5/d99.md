The Fifth U.S. Army Conference on Applied Statistics was hosted by the United States Military Academy, West Point 19-21 October, 1999. The conference was co-sponsored by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL), the U.S. Army Research Office (ARO), the United States Military Academy (USMA), the Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Analysis Center-White Sands Missile Range, the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), and the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST). Fifty people attended.

The fifth conference was preceded by a short course, "Data Mining with Decision Trees," given by Wei-Yin Loh of the University of Wisconsin, Madison. The conference was opened by BG Fletcher M. Lamkin, Jr., Dean of the Academic Board, United States Military Academy, and conference host COL David C. Arney, Chair of the Department of Mathematical Sciences, United States Military Academy. Distinguished speakers during invited general sessions included: Edward Wegman (keynote), George Mason University, Jayaram Sethuraman,
Florida State University, Ingram Olkin, Stanford University, Daryl Pregibon, ATT, Charles McCulloch, Cornell University, and David Banks, Bureau of Transportation Statistics.

Papers covered a range of topics. Data mining was most prevalent. Other talks included applications in image analysis, linear models, Bayesian methods, statistical process control, life testing, and field test assessment. An important moment in the conference was the awarding of the Army Wilks Award to Edward J. Wegman of the George Mason University.
