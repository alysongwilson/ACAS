    <P><I>Warranty Contracts and Equilibrium Probabilities (Keynote 
        Address)<BR>Nozer Singpurwalla, George Washington University</I>
        <BR>The scenario of warranties is at the interface of philosophy, law, and 
probability. In this talk we describe a real life scenario involving litigation 
pertaining to a breach of warranty and discuss its ramifications from a 
statistical point of view. We claim that the three interpretations of 
probability, the objective, the subjective and the logical all come into play 
when designing an optimum warranty that is also just.</P>
    <P><I>Variance and Invariance in Machine Vision<BR>Stuart Geman, Brown 
        University</I><br>I will propose a computer vision system based upon a collection of 
scale-invariant composition rules that define a part-whole hierarchy. I will 
make a connection to some striking invariance properties of natural images. I 
will suggest a coarse-to-fine computing engine for scene analysis within the 
compositional framework. I will discuss some experimental results and make some 
connections to biological vision systems.</P>

    Agents<BR></I>George Weinstock, Department of Molecular Virology and 
    Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine</I><br>Bacteria contain a number of genes that contribute to their ability to cause 
human infections and to resist the action of antibiotics. However only a subset 
of bacteria within a given species contain these genes. Thus, some bacteria of a 
species contain only a few genes involved in infection while others contain many 
such genes. These pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance genes can be 
transferred between bacteria of the same species and often between bacteria of 
different species. In addition, these genes can be inserted into bacteria in the 
laboratory by recombinant DNA techniques, which facilitates the design and 
construction of bacteria that are highly virulent and also resistant to most 
antibiotics. Engineered bacteria of this type represent possible biological 
warfare or terrorism agents. Genomics technologies such as high-throughput 
sequencing and DNA chips are mechanisms by which the constellation of 
pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance genes of any bacterial isolate can 
rapidly be assessed.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

    <P><I>The Use of Cluster Analysis in the MOUT ACTD<BR>Eugene Dutoit, 
    Dismounted Battlespace Battle Lab, Fort Benning</I><br>As part of the MOUT ACTD, a simulation study was conducted to determine the 
operational effects, with respect to communication, on clearing a building floor 
consisting of a series of rooms in a typical urban setting. The Blue force was 
attacking and the Threat force was defending the floor. Prior to the 
force-on-force simulations, the study agency wanted to determine, in advance, 
the probable communication locations (or nodes) on the floor that the attacking 
force would use to coordinate the attack. Subject matter experts,(SMEs), were 
given floor diagrams and a detailed description of the scenario and asked to 
identify, on the diagram, all the possible places they believed that 
communications would occur. A clustering algorithm was used to determine if the 
group of SMEs were reasonably consistent among themselves as to the location of 
the subjectively positioned communication nodes. This paper will present the 
results of this portion of the study and present a simple measure of subjective 
clustering effectiveness.</P>
    <P><I>A Human Factors Analysis of Two Proposed Tactical Operations Center 
    (TOC) Shelter Designs<BR>Jock Grynovicki, Kragg Kysor, and Madeline 
    Swann, Army Research Laboratory</I><br>The U.S. Army currently fields the Standard Integrated Command Post 
System-Extensions (SICPS-E) tent shelter system with its command post vehicles 
to form a tactical operations center (TOC). Although the currently fielded 
SICPS-E system contains a common workspace, it does not provide an open 
architecture within which staffs can better perform their functions. An open 
architecture allows for the uninterrupted view of Command Information Center 
(CIC) displays and unimpeded movement of personnel within the shelter. Given 
that the currently fielded SICPS-E system is not ideal, the issue becomes "What 
type of form should future TOCs take?" In early 1997, the Vice Chief of Staff, Army (VCSA) established a policy to 
address TOC development. The intent was to leverage all of the financial and 
intellectual efforts from across many communities to focus on systems that 
provide commanders and their staffs the facilities and information required for 
making military decisions. Subsequently, the Training and Doctrine Command 
(TRADOC) Program Integration Office-Army Battle Command System (TPIO-ABCS) was 
assigned the responsibility for focusing TOC development. In early 1999, HQ TRADOC and the Army Digitization Office (ADO) requested 
that a high-level body (i.e., "TOC Summit") address the issues that resulted 
from the complexity of TOC development. Through the TOC Summit venue, it was 
recognized that the currently fielded SICPS-E system may not suffice as the 
sheltering system for future U.S. Army TOCs. The Commander, Combined Arms Center 
(CAC) directed the TRADOC Analysis Center-Fort Leavenworth (TRAC-FLVN) to 
provide analyses to inform a November 2000 decision on the form to select for 
the Army's future division-level and brigade-level TOCs. Consequently, TRAC-FLVN 
requested that ARL-HRED provide human factors analysis support for the November 
2000 decision regarding a (1) Mobile Expandable Container Configuration (MECC) 
and a (2) Custom Tent design. As part of a "Cognitive Engineering of the 
Battlefield" Science and Technology Objective (STO), the ARL-HRED developed a 
survey instrument to assess human factors, battlefield management, 
collaboration, modularity, mobility and security issues. This paper presents an 
approach to the statistical data collection, human factors analysis, and 
quantitative results that will be provided to support the decision makers on the 
form (i.e., platform or shelter) to select for the U.S. Army's future 
division-level TOCs.</P>
    <P><I>Exploring the Use of Reading Comprehension Tests in Evaluating Machine 
    Translation Systems<BR>Barbara Broome, Ann Brodeen, and Frederick 
    Brundick, Army Research Laboratory and Malcolm Taylor, OAO 
    Corporation</I><BR>Machine translation (MT) is a computer-based application that seeks to 
convert the content of a passage provided in one human language to another. The 
Army, in particular, with its land operations in foreign countries and its use 
of coalition forces, stands to benefit from translation tools. Defense efforts 
like the Army's Forward Area Language Converter program and the Defense Advanced 
Research Projects Agency's Trans-lingual Information Detection, Extraction and 
Summarization program are examples of ongoing efforts to leverage and develop 
translation tools to support the soldier at all echelons. In earlier studies, a 
variety of evaluation techniques were employed. Most involved subjective 
assessments of translation quality, emphasizing the correctness of syntax, 
morphology, and semantics. Our research explores the use of reading 
comprehension tests to establish a baseline in the evaluation of MT technology. 
This paper describes the results of a pilot study in which we employ a 
standardized reading comprehension test to assess the effectiveness of a French 
MT system.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

    <P><I>Computer Network Tomography for End-to-End Traffic 
        Measurements<BR>Robert Nowak and Mark Coates, Rice University</I><BR>
   In many situations, the ability to determine whether a packet-based 
communication network is performing correctly is vital, but the network must not 
be overburdened by probing test traffic. If it is determined that the network is 
functioning suboptimally, localization of the dysfunction is a key step towards 
mitigating the problem. The fundamental objective of this work is to determine 
the extent to which unicast, end-to-end network measurement is capable of 
determining internal (not directly measurable) packet losses - the so-called 
network tomography problem. The major contributions of this paper are two-fold: 
we formulate a measurement procedure for network loss inference based on 
end-to-end packet pair measurements, and we develop a statistical modeling and 
computation framework for inferring internal network loss characteristics. 
Simulation experiments demonstrate the potential of our new 
        framework.</P>
    <P><I>Modeling Transmission Loss in a Network with a Large Number of 
        Nodes<BR>     
        Jayaram Sethuraman, Florida State University</I><BR>
        Suppose that a signal with an initial strength from an originating node is 
transmitted through a network with a large number of intermediate nodes. There 
will be dissipation as well as some boosting of the signal between nodes. We 
will explore a general probabilistic model for the total loss in transmission, 
i.e. for the final strength of signal after passing though a large number of 
nodes. To make the problem more mathematical, we assume that a signal has strength 
X_0 at the originating node 0 and it is transmitted through a path consisting of 
nodes i=1,2,...,n. Denote the strength of the signal at node i by X_i, 
i=1,2,...,n. The nodes themselves do not have to be on a straight line, they are 
the nodes along a certain path. The ratio p_i=X_i/X_(i-1) represents the 
loss/boost factor at node i; p_i &lt;1 means that there was a loss and p_i &gt;1 
means that there was a boost to the signal at node i. We are interested in 
strength X_n of the final signal after it comes through node n, or more 
particularly the final loss/boost factor Z_n =X_n/X_0. We present a 
probabilistic model for the loss/boost factors p_1,...,p_n and obtain simple 
limiting distributions for the final loss/boost factor Z_n. In some models, the 
mean of the final loss/boost factor is 1 indicating that on the average there is 
no loss. In these cases, one can examine the variance, which we obtain, to 
devise systems with tolerable amounts of fluctuations while the same time there 
is no loss of strength on the average. In other probabilistic models, there will 
be a loss or boost in the strength of the final signal. This information can be 
        useful in designing robust systems.</P>

        Wireless Communications</I><BR>Rong Chen, University of Illinois, Chicago, 
    Jun Liu, Stanford University and Xiaodong Wang, Texas A&M 
  University<BR>
        Monte Carlo filter is a sequential imputation method designed for on-line 
signal extraction for nonlinear/nonGaussian dynamic systems and state-space 
models. We provide a general framework and several special Monte Carlo filtering 
algorithms and discuss their wide applications, particularly in target tracking 
and digital wireless communications.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
