<h4>Presentation on April 18, 2024</h4>
Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Mike Powell. Iâ€™m joining you today from the Department of Mathematical Sciences at West Point where I work in the Applied Statistics and Data Science program.

Thank you for joining me to honor an outstanding individual whose work in statistical sciences has had a profound impact not only on the practice of statistics, but also on our national security. It is my pleasure to announce Dr. Christine Anderson-Cook as the recipient of the Army Wilks Memorial Award.

Established in 1964, the Wilks Award recognizes statisticians who contribute to the advancement of scientific or technical knowledge in Army statistics, and more generally, to the Department of Defense and the government of the Unites States. Dr. Anderson-Cook exemplifies this criterion through her many exceptional achievements.

Dr. Anderson-Cook's career at Los Alamos National Laboratory began in 2004 and has been marked by remarkable technical leadership. With expertise in statistical methods for experimental design, reliability, and quality, she has made significant contributions to her field.

Her extensive publication record, including 250 peer-reviewed journal articles and three books, demonstrates her commitment to advancing statistical methodologies. Notably, her research on complex system health assessment and munitions stockpile reliability assessment has directly benefited our nation's defense capabilities.

Internationally recognized for her work, Dr. Anderson-Cook has received prestigious awards such as the George Box Medal and special recognition as the Conference Honoree at the Quality and Productivity Research Conference. Additionally, her dedication to mentorship has been acknowledged with multiple mentorship awards at Los Alamos National Laboratory.

Clearly, Dr. Christine Anderson-Cook's contributions embody the spirit of the Army Wilks Memorial Award. Her dedication to advancing statistical science and her impact on national security make her a deserving recipient of this award.

Please join me in congratulating Dr. Christine Anderson-Cook on this well-deserved honor.

Thank you.
