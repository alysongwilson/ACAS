<P><B>Abstract:</B></P>
<P>The class of generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) is a broad class of 
statistical models generalizing both linear mixed models and generalized linear 
models (GLMs). As such it is capable of accommodating nonlinear responses, 
correlated data and non-normal distributions. This makes it quite useful in 
practice. For example, GLMMs give a natural way to specify a correlated data 
model for binary data. After briefly introducing generalized linear models 
Professor McCulloch will describe the extension to GLMMs. The focus in the 
course will be on approaches to modeling, methods of estimation and inference, 
and available software. The concepts will be illustrated on a number of 
examples.<BR></P>
