2000<BR>AMSRL-WM-BC<BR>SUBJECT: U.S. Army Conference on Applied 
Statistics<BR><BR>Dear Colleague,<BR><BR>The Executive Board of the U.S. 
Army Conference on Applied Statistics is pleased to announce that Rice 
University will host its sixth annual conference in Houston, Texas on October 
18-20, 2000.<BR><BR>The U.S. Army Conference on Applied Statistics is a 
forum for the presentation of theoretical and applied papers relating 
to the use of probability and statistics in solving Army problems. 
Today's Army faces far-ranging challenges that encompass many topics in 
which probability and statistics can contribute. To name a few, data 
mining, simulation, linear and nonlinear modeling, statistical 
control, data fusion, survival analysis, and experimental design play 
essential roles in the development and advancement of Army systems. It 
is the Board's goal that conference attendees include 
scientists ranging from statisticians with research interests to 
practitioners in other disciplines involved in the collection and 
interpretation of data.<BR><BR>A short course entitled "Data, Knowledge, and 
Information Integration to Support Decision Making", taught by Dr. 
Sallie Keller-McNulty and staff of Los Alamos National Laboratory, will 
precede the conference on October 16-17. The course will cover 
structured, quantitative approaches for combining data, knowledge, and 
information from multiple sources and in various forms (including 
both quantitative and qualitative) to support decision making. 
Techniques from various disciplines, including state-of-the-art expert 
elicitation, statistical and reliability analysis, and knowledge management, 
will be discussed and applied to develop formal methods for information 
integration. Possible DoD applications will be addressed.<BR><BR>The 
conference program will consist of invited talks by prominent investigators in 
various branches of statistics and applied probability as well as 
contributed papers of a technical, applied, or clinical nature. To 
date, the following distinguished researchers have been confirmed for 
invited presentations: J. Stuart Hunter (Princeton; keynote address), 
Alan Agresti (Florida), Donald A. Berry (Duke), Noel A. C. Cressie 
(Ohio State), Stuart A. Geman (Brown), Naomi Oreskes (UC San Diego), 
and Emanuel Parzen (Texas A&M).<BR><BR>Three special sessions will 
highlight this year's conference: 1) Biological Warfare, organized by 
Marek Kimmel of Rice University. In this session, statistical questions will be 
examined in the context of biological warfare; for example, the 
population impact of an accidental epidemic and the accuracy of impact 
predictions. 2) Digital Government, organized by Edward Wegman of George 
Mason University. The basic premise and structure of the Digital 
Government initiative will be the focus of this session, along with 
discussions on security issues and information warfare. 3) Reliability, 
organized by Arthur Fries of the Institute for Defense Analysis. 
Highlights of the June 2000 National Research Council "Workshop on 
Reliability Issues of DoD Systems" will be shared in this session.<BR><BR>The 
technical session of the conference will also feature contributed papers by Army 
scientists, and academic and industrial scientists, including 
investigators under contract to the Army. Contributed papers can vary 
in content from new research to well-posed problems in which statistical methods 
are applied to solve specific Army problems. Speakers are strongly 
encouraged to present their papers in terms of the potential or real 
problems that motivated the work. Results that rely on relatively recent 
or specialized results in the theory of statistics and probability 
should be explained in sufficient detail to permit an audience of 
statistical practitioners with broadly varying backgrounds to use the results 
to enhance their own problem-solving capabilities.<BR><BR>A distinct 
element of this conference is its Clinical Sessions. Presentations in these 
sessions feature applied statistics problems which have not been 
completely or satisfactorily solved, and for which the presenter seeks 
assistance in developing a satisfactory approach. A panel of experts, composed 
of invited speakers and other distinguished attendees, is convened for 
each clinical session for the purpose of providing guidance. Authors of 
a clinical paper must provide a brief description of the problem 
by September 22, 2000 in order that the panelists have sufficient time 
to prepare their recommendations. We invite you to consider this 
opportunity to present a bothersome statistical problem to some of 
the country's leading applied and mathematical 
statisticians.<BR><BR>Participation from many activities is sought to ensure a 
mixture of science and application. A call for papers is hereby 
extended. Speakers will be notified regarding paper acceptance no later 
than September 8. It may become necessary to limit the number of 
papers, so a timely response is recommended. To submit a paper for 
consideration, please send the following information by August 18 to 
Barry A. Bodt, U.S. Army Research Laboratory, ATTN: AMSRL-CI-CD, Aberdeen 
Proving Ground, MD 21005-5067. (Electronic mail sent to 
babodt@arl.army.mil is preferred.)<BR><BR>1. Title of paper, and a short 
abstract written in standard ASCII text.<BR>2. Name of author(s) and exact title 
of the organization(s).<BR>3. Type of paper (technical or clinical).<BR>4. 
Equipment needed (overhead, slide projector, etc.).<BR>5. Telephone number of 
the author(s) (DSN or commercial).<BR>6. E-mail address of the 
author(s).<BR><BR>Clinical and technical papers are nominally 30 minutes and 20 
minutes, respectively. Of the 30 minutes available for clinical papers, 
approximately 10 minutes are recommended for the problem statement, 
allowing 20 minutes for panel discussion. The agenda will be structured to 
provide some discussion time between papers.<BR><BR>The conference also 
marks the occasion when the Army Wilks award is presented for 
significant contributions to the U.S. Army in the areas of statistical 
research, applications, and/or consulting. This year the Board is 
accepting open nominations for award candidates. Letters of nomination 
should include the nominee's vita relevant to Army service, and should 
be mailed by July 14, 2000 to Jock O. Grynovicki, U.S. Army Research 
Laboratory, ATTN: AMSRL-HR-IS, Aberdeen Proving Ground, 
MD&nbsp;<BR>21005-5425.<BR><BR>The campus of Rice University is centrally 
located in Houston, Texas, the fourth largest city in the nation. 
Houston offers a tremendous variety of activities and attractions for visitors. 
The area's top tourist attraction is the Houston Space Center, a museum 
celebrating the accomplishments of NASA and the American manned space 
flight program. Other nearby attractions include the Houston Museum 
of Natural Science, the Houston Zoo, the nearby Rice Village Shopping 
Center, and several art galleries and museums. Performing arts 
attractions include the Houston Symphony, the Houston Grand Opera, and 
numerous venues for all musical tastes including regional blues, county-western, 
and Tejano. Sports fans can catch the excitement of Houston Rockets NBA 
basketball, NCAA football at any of several local universities, or 
racing at Gulf Greyhound Park. Houston's culinary landmarks include 
its steakhouses, Cajun crab shacks, Tex-Mex taquerias and barbecue 
joints, but the diversity of its population has also spawned a wealth 
of fine ethnic restaurants.<BR><BR>This year's conference is sponsored by the 
U.S. Army Research Laboratory, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, 
United States Military Academy, TRADOC Analysis Center - WSMR, 
Army Research Office, and National Institute for Standards and 
Technology - with cooperation from Los Alamos National Laboratory, 
RAND, George Mason University, Rice University, Office of 
Naval Research, and Institute for Defense Analysis. Conference meetings 
will convene in the newly constructed Duncan Hall on the Rice campus, 
and a block of rooms has been reserved at the nearby Crowne Plaza 
Hotel, Houston Medical Center. A host letter providing more detailed 
information regarding registration fees, additional lodging, agenda, 
etc. will follow in August. Prior to this mailing, information 
concerning the conference and tutorial can be obtained via the Internet 
at http://rpstl.arl.mil/isb/acas/. Any additional inquiries concerning 
the conference may be directed to Barry A. Bodt at the address noted 
previously, by phone (410-278-6659), or by fax 
(410-278-4988).<BR><BR>Sincerely,<BR>David W.
