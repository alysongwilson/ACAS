### Tutorial 2016: Introduction to R and Data Visualization
Instructor: Abel Rodriguez, Professor, Applied Mathematics and Statistics, University of California, Santa Cruz, abel@ams.ucsc.edu

This short course covers two distinct but interrelated topics: it provides both an introduction to R (one of the premier languages for statistical analysis) 
and to data visualization techniques (and how to implement them using R).  The course is divided into 6 sessions of 105 minutes each (for a notional total of 
10.5 hours of instruction). <i>Participants are expected to bring their own computers to work alongside the instructor on examples.</i>
					
There are numerous books and online courses on R.  There is also a multiplicity of books on Data Visualization.  Below are my favorites, and I have based 
important portions of the course on material extracted from them.
